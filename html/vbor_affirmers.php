            <h2>WHAT IT MEANS TO AFFIRM</h2>
            <p><b>By affirming the Veterans' Bill of Rights, Members are not pledging support for specific
                    legislation, but rather are making a statement of principle for actions to be taken in support
                    of our American Veterans. </b></p>
            <p>As in years past, the Circle of Friends for American Veterans proudly publicizes members who affirm
                the Veterans' Bill of Rights as champions for American Veterans to the national, regional, and local
                media in every state and Congressional District in America. </p>

                Their affirmations demonstrate their dedication to support the veterans of our nation and help do their
                part to fix the issues that our American Heroes face everyday.
