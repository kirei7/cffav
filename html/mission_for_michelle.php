            <h1>MISSION FOR MICHELLE</h1>
            <p>The Circle of Friends for American Veterans recently received a call from a veteran's family that they
                need emergency help to keep themselves in their house. </p>
            <p>They have been tied up with Freedom Mortgage Lenders and need help fast in order to keep the children in
                the house. </p>

            <p><strong>Michelle, the wife, had been married to a veteran for 24 years before he left her and their two
                    children behind, and was arrested for a year. </strong></p>
            <p>He then hid his disability from her and their two children when she filed for a divorce. She has been
                working since this and has had to chose between feeding her family or paying her mortgage, which the
                husband has also stopped paying. He has not been providing financial support for the children, so the
                mother went to the Veterans' Administration to apply for hardship so she could keep her house while she
                looked for more work. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-6">
            <p><strong>This was two years ago</strong>,and she has heard nothing back from them. She now owes 18,000 on
                her house. She has raised some funds by herself, but still needs 12,000 or she will lose her house.
                </p>
            <p>The Circle of Friends has been working with her for quite a while and has been trying to slow down the
                process of foreclosure so we have more time to raise the funds for Michelle.</p>
